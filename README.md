# Viz-Man

A full-screen music visualizer for LG webOS TVs. It plays no audio: it draws
what [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/) is playing on your
speakers, in time with it.

Built for an LG CX (webOS 5, Chromium 68) and installed on a rooted TV with
[Glasshouse](https://github.com/rorygallagher2024/lg-webos-dashboard).

## What it shows

| Visualizer | Needs |
|---|---|
| Winamp Bars, Winamp Thin Bars, Winamp Scope: the Winamp 2 spectrum analyzer and oscilloscope | Canvas 2D |
| Radial bars, Ribbon, Ring scope, Lissajous, Kaleidoscope, Spirograph, Tunnel, Orbitals | Canvas 2D |
| MilkDrop presets through Butterchurn; pick one with ↑/↓, or have it change on a timer | WebGL2 |

MilkDrop is offered only if the TV gives out a WebGL2 context, and is taken
out of rotation if it fails to start or loses its context. A preset that stays
below 20 fps is skipped and remembered. The presets shipped are the ones named
in `presets.json`: those of the 395 in the butterchurn-presets packs that ran
at 45 fps or better on the CX (`bench/lg-cx-webos5.json` has every result;
`npm run bench` produces it).
The eight middle visualizers are coloured from the playing album's artwork.
Everything unlit is true black.

## How it gets the music

Music Assistant's **MilkDrop Visualizer** plugin streams the waveform of
whatever a player is playing over a WebSocket (`/milkdrop_visualizer`), a few
seconds ahead of time, along with beats and album colours. The app:

- finds a player whose queue is playing (or uses the one named in `player`),
- buffers the frames and shows each when the server's clock reaches it,
- downsamples hi-res streams (96 kHz, 192 kHz) to about 48 kHz,
- levels quiet tracks so they still fill the display.

The plugin must be added in Music Assistant (Settings → Plugins), and the app
needs a long-lived token for a Music Assistant user.

## Remote

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ← / → | Previous / next visualizer |
| ↑ / ↓ | MilkDrop: next / previous preset |
| OK | Menu: visualizer, preset, preset timer, sync trim, Winamp colours, auto level, frame rate cap, hold screen when idle, debug readout |
| Red / Green | Sync trim −25 ms / +25 ms |
| Back | Close the menu, or leave the app |

While music plays the app stops the TV's screensaver from starting; when it
stops, the screensaver runs as usual unless "Hold screen when idle" is on.

## Settings

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.local.json` (git-ignored):

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `host` | Music Assistant's address. An IP; `host:port` if it is not on 8095 |
| `token` | Long-lived Music Assistant token |
| `player` | Optional: a player id to watch instead of following whatever plays |
| `holdWhenIdle` | Keep the screensaver off while nothing plays |
| `report` | Address of a running dev server to report to (testing only) |

These are baked into the package at build time, so **the package contains the
token**. webOS launch parameters override them, and the query string overrides
both when the page is opened in a browser.

## Build and install

```
npm install
npm run package        # dist/net.botworth.vizman_<version>_all.ipk
```

Hand the `.ipk` to Glasshouse (Apps tab, with sideloading on), either by
uploading the file or by URL. `npm run serve-ipk` serves `dist/` on port 8138
for the URL route; stop it afterwards.

## Develop

```
npm test               # node --test
npm run dev            # serves app/ on port 8137
npm run probe -- <player_id> [seconds]   # print what the relay sends
npm run bench          # time every MilkDrop preset on a linked page (the TV)
```

Open `http://<host>:8137/?report=1&debug=1` in a desktop browser. Useful
query flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `mock=1` | Synthetic signal instead of Music Assistant |
| `debug=1` | On-screen readout: frame rate, connection, buffer, errors |
| `report=1` | Post status and snapshots to the dev server, and take commands from it |
| `noWebgl=1` | Behave as if WebGL2 were missing |
| `player=<id>` | Watch one player |

With `report=1` the page holds a WebSocket to the dev server, which writes
the page's `status-*.json` and snapshots into `.dev/` and passes on commands:

```
curl -d '{"type":"snapshot"}' http://localhost:8137/cmd
curl -d '{"type":"key","key":"right"}' http://localhost:8137/cmd
curl -d '{"type":"mode","id":"winamp-bars"}' http://localhost:8137/cmd
curl -d '{"type":"blacks"}' http://localhost:8137/cmd
```

The dev server serves `app/config.js`, token included, to anyone who can reach
the port. Run it only while testing.
